# College Network Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates a comprehensive college network using Cisco's Packet Tracer tool. The simulation includes various network components and configurations to mimic the real-world network infrastructure of a college. The project covers network design, device configurations, and testing of the network to ensure reliable connectivity and performance.

## Network Design
The college network is divided into several segments:
1. **Administration Network**: Secure network for administrative staff and critical operations.
2. **Faculty Network**: Dedicated network for faculty members.
3. **Student Network**: Segregated network for student access.
4. **Server Farm**: Centralized servers for applications, databases, and storage.

## Implementation
### Step-by-Step Configuration
1. **VLAN Configuration**:
   - Create VLANs for administration, faculty, students, and guests.
   - Assign appropriate ports on switches to each VLAN.

2. **IP Addressing**:
   - Assign IP address ranges to each network segment.
   - Configure DHCP servers to provide dynamic IP addresses to clients.

3. **Routing Protocols**:
   - Configure routing protocols like OSPF or EIGRP on routers to facilitate inter-segment communication.

4. **Security Measures**:
   - Implement ACLs on routers to control access between different network segments.
   - Configure firewalls to protect against external threats.

5. **Wireless Network Setup**:
   - Set up SSIDs for faculty, students, and guests.
   - Implement WPA2 security for wireless networks.

## Testing and Verification
### Simulation Scenarios
1. **Basic Connectivity**:
   - Ping between devices in the same VLAN.
   - Ping between devices in different VLANs to verify routing.

2. **DHCP Verification**:
   - Check if devices receive IP addresses from the DHCP server.

3. **Access Control**:
   - Verify that ACLs are correctly restricting access between network segments.

4. **Wireless Connectivity**:
   - Test wireless connectivity for faculty, student, and guest networks.

## Results
- **Simulation Outputs**:
  - Successful pings and communication between devices indicate correct VLAN and routing configurations.
  - DHCP server correctly assigning IP addresses to clients.
  - ACLs effectively restricting access as per security policies.
  - Wireless devices connecting securely to their respective networks.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the design, implementation, and testing of a college network using Cisco's Packet Tracer tool. The simulation validates the networkâ€™s reliability, security, and performance, ensuring that it meets the requirements of a typical college environment.
